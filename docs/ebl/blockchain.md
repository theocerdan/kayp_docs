# Why is blockchain a value-added feature for KAYP?

The KAYP project leverages blockchain technology to address a critical issue: enabling international trade participants to eliminate the need for trust between various stakeholders.

Thanks to blockchain, we can ensure that the signature of an official document is authentic and tamper-proof, even in a digital environment. This allows maritime trade actors to move away from relying on mutual trust or a third party. Each transaction and document is recorded transparently, immutably, and securely, compelling all stakeholders to align with the authenticity of the shared information. Blockchain, in essence, becomes a "giant authentication system" where the interests of all parties are harmonized.

Beyond that, blockchain offers additional benefits:

- **Enhanced Security:** Blockchain technology has proven its robustness against cyberattacks. Sensitive data, such as the information contained in maritime trade documents, is encrypted and cannot be altered once stored on the chain.

- **Transparency and Traceability:** Every modification or exchange of a document is permanently recorded, providing complete traceability of the exchanges and reducing the risk of fraud or disputes. This is ideal for auditing these processes.

- **Efficiency and Cost Reduction:** By eliminating intermediaries and manual verification processes, blockchain not only reduces transaction costs but also speeds up document processing.

## How does this manifest?

Practically, here's what blockchain allows:

- **Automation of Transactions:** For instance, once a shipper confirms the shipment of goods and the recipient acknowledges receipt, the smart contract can automatically update the document status and track every modification or validation with the document's step-by-step history.

- **Reliability and Transparency:** Each step of the process is encrypted and immutably recorded on the blockchain. This ensures that the terms of the contract and the actions taken remain confidential and cannot be altered afterward.

Our smart contract primarily aims to certify the authenticity of the eBL documents using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology to ensure data confidentiality, even when stored on the blockchain.

In a later phase, an oracle connection will be implemented to provide real-time updates on the status of transactions or documents. This will enable transparent and secure tracking while reliably incorporating external information.

Lastly, the addition of an escrow system will enhance transaction security. The escrow acts as a trusted third party ensuring that predefined contract conditions are met before releasing the funds or documents. This is especially useful in complex transactions involving multiple stakeholders, where transparency and security are paramount. Through this escrow, parties can be assured that goods and payments are exchanged fairly, reducing the risk of disputes or fraud.

## Securing Documents

Maritime trade documents are stored on the blockchain. Each document is:

- **Timestamped:** Every action related to a document (such as a signature, modification, or transfer of ownership) is recorded with a precise date and time, ensuring complete traceability.

- **Authenticated:** Thanks to cryptographic mechanisms, documents on the blockchain cannot be altered or tampered with after their creation. Only authorized individuals can interact with them.

- **Accessible:** We have full control over which stakeholder is authorized to use and view our documents.

## Escrow and Payment Management

Another critical aspect is the use of escrow accounts on the blockchain to manage payments securely. An escrow is a mechanism that holds funds until the contract terms are met. Here's how it works:

- **Protecting Parties:** Funds (for example, payment for a shipment) can be placed in a secure escrow account. They will only be released once the conditions specified in the smart contract (such as the receipt of goods) have been verified and validated via the blockchain.

- **Fund Inviolability:** Funds stored in blockchain escrows cannot be diverted or stolen, and their release is automatic once conditions are met.

- **Efficiency & Costs:** Blockchain allows for instant and cost-effective access to financing.

## Compliance and Regulations

KAYP also integrates regulatory compliance mechanisms through blockchain. For example:

- **Stakeholder Identification:** Through automated and blockchain-recorded Know Your Customer (KYC) verification processes (cf. vLEI), companies submitting financing requests or signing contracts can be securely and verifiably identified.

- **Fund Traceability:** In financial transactions (such as trade finance), blockchain enables tracing the origin of funds to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) rules.
