<p class="description">Encountering an issue with KAYP? Check these frequently asked questions to troubleshoot common problems.</p>

If you still can't find the information you need, feel free to visit our [support page](/kayp/getting-started/support/).

## KAYP is a valuable solution. How can I support its development?

There are several ways to contribute to KAYP’s growth:

- **Spread the word.** Share KAYP’s benefits by [linking to kayp.io](https://kayp.io/) on your website or network. Follow us on social media, share updates, and talk about KAYP with your colleagues or industry peers.
- **Give feedback.** Share your experience with KAYP and suggest improvements. Upvote issues that you think should be prioritized for resolution.

## Why are my shipment documents not updating?

This issue is often related to synchronization between the involved parties. Ensure that all stakeholders (shippers, carriers, consignees) have properly updated their shipment documentation. Also, verify that you have the necessary permissions to make updates. If the issue persists, please check the documentation for troubleshooting steps or contact support.

## How do I create a new shipment in KAYP?

To create a new shipment in KAYP, follow these steps:
1. Log in to your account.
2. Navigate to the "Shipments" tab.
3. Click on the "Create Shipment" button.
4. Fill in the required details, such as shipper information, consignee, cargo details, and any relevant documents.
5. Submit the shipment request to the carrier for eB/L generation.

For detailed instructions, refer to the [Creating a Shipment guide](https://kayp.io/docs/create-shipment).

## How can I customize the notification settings?

To adjust your notification settings:
1. Go to your profile settings.
2. Navigate to the "Notifications" tab.
3. Customize how and when you receive notifications (e.g., email, platform notifications) based on shipment updates, document approvals, and more.

Ensure that email notifications are not being filtered by your email provider, and check your spam folder if you’re missing updates.

## How can I track the status of a shipment?

Once a shipment is created, you can track its status through the "Shipments" tab. Each shipment will display its current status (e.g., pending, in transit, delivered) and provide real-time updates as the cargo moves through the supply chain.

For more details on tracking and shipment visibility, visit the [Shipment Tracking guide](https://kayp.io/docs/tracking).

## Why can't I generate the Bill of Lading (B/L)?

Only authorized carriers can generate an electronic Bill of Lading (eB/L) in KAYP. If you are a shipper, you can request the creation of an eB/L, but the final document must be created by the carrier. Ensure all required documents are submitted and that your request has been properly sent to the carrier.

## Can I integrate KAYP with other software?

Yes, KAYP is designed to integrate with various Transport Management Systems (TMS) and Port Community Systems (PCS) via API. This allows for seamless communication between your logistics tools and KAYP. For more information on integration, visit our [API documentation](https://kayp.io/api).

## What should I do if I encounter a technical issue with KAYP?

If you experience any technical issues, you can:
1. Check the [support page](https://kayp.io/support) for common troubleshooting steps.
2. Report the issue via the platform or [create a support ticket](https://kayp.io/support/ticket).
3. Ensure your browser and system meet the [technical requirements](https://kayp.io/docs/requirements) for running KAYP.

## How does KAYP handle data privacy?

KAYP complies with international data privacy regulations, including GDPR. All data related to shipments and documents is encrypted and stored securely. For more details, refer to our [Privacy Policy](https://kayp.io/privacy).

## Why are my shipment updates delayed?

Delays in shipment updates could be due to synchronization issues with the carrier or consignee. Ensure that all parties are using the most up-to-date version of the KAYP platform. If the issue persists, verify your internet connection or contact KAYP support for assistance.
