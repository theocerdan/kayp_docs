# Design Resources

<p class="description">Boost your efficiency in designing and developing with KAYP's design system, which will soon evolve into a full library for all front-end applications.</p>

## Design Kits

Currently, KAYP offers a design **prototype** available on Figma. This maquette helps teams visualize and collaborate on the future UI components of KAYP. [Access the KAYP design kit on Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/xxsDaNQ03MoLlKS0xJLPwK/Kayp?node-id=382-19698&t=1JsSUn1acrqfNqIB-1).

However, our ultimate goal is to develop a fully-fledged design library based on **Shadcn**, a modern design system that prioritizes scalability and consistency. This library will be integrated into all KAYP front-end applications, offering a unified and cohesive design experience across the platform.

## What is Shadcn?

**Shadcn** is a hybrid design system combining the principles of component-based design and utility-first CSS (like Tailwind CSS). It offers flexibility and customization while maintaining a consistent design language. The system is built to scale across large applications, ensuring that every component remains adaptable and reusable.

- **Scalability:** Shadcn is optimized for large projects, making it easy to maintain and evolve the design as KAYP grows.
- **Customization:** It allows teams to modify components while adhering to a common set of design principles, ensuring flexibility without sacrificing consistency.
- **Utility-first:** Shadcn integrates well with utility-first CSS frameworks, like Tailwind CSS, enabling rapid development and prototyping.

With Shadcn, KAYP will ensure that its design system is not only visually appealing but also highly functional and easy to maintain for all front-end teams.
