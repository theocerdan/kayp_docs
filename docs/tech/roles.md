# Stakeholders in DCSA-Compliant API Usage

<p class="description">Learn about the different roles and stakeholders involved in the usage of APIs compliant with the Digital Container Shipping Association (DCSA) standards.</p>

## Introduction

In the context of shipping and logistics, several key stakeholders interact with APIs that comply with the **Digital Container Shipping Association (DCSA)** standards. These stakeholders include various roles, each responsible for specific functions in the shipping process. DCSA-compliant APIs aim to streamline communication, improve transparency, and ensure standardization across the industry.

The main stakeholders involved in this ecosystem include **Shippers**, **Consignees**, **Carriers**, **Banks**, **Customs Authorities**, and **Port Systems**. Each of these roles plays a crucial part in the process, from creating shipments to facilitating customs clearance and financing.

## Key Stakeholders and Their Roles

### 1. **Shipper**

The **Shipper** is the party that initiates the shipping process by requesting transportation for goods. Shippers are typically the manufacturers, suppliers, or sellers who want to transport goods to a buyer or consignee. They rely on DCSA-compliant APIs to:
- **Create a shipment**: Provide all necessary details to initiate the shipment, including cargo information, destination, and required documents.
- **Request a Bill of Lading (B/L)**: Submit requests to carriers to issue the electronic Bill of Lading (eB/L) following DCSA standards.
- **Track shipments**: Use APIs to get real-time updates on the status of their cargo.
- **Communicate with Carriers**: Exchange essential shipping data with carriers and other stakeholders, ensuring all parties have up-to-date information.

#### Key Responsibilities:
- Shipment creation and booking
- Provision of accurate cargo details
- Coordinating the issuance of the eB/L
- Facilitating the transfer of title through the eB/L

### 2. **Consignee**

The **Consignee** is the party receiving the shipment. Consignees are usually the buyers or customers who are expecting delivery of goods from the shipper. Consignees rely on DCSA-compliant APIs to:
- **Track shipments**: Monitor the shipment status and receive updates on estimated arrival times.
- **Receive the eB/L**: Claim ownership of the goods through the electronic Bill of Lading.
- **Coordinate with Customs and Carriers**: Ensure that all legal and logistical processes are followed to receive the cargo.

#### Key Responsibilities:
- Managing delivery and customs clearance
- Receiving the electronic Bill of Lading
- Tracking shipment status in real-time
- Claiming ownership and coordinating final delivery

### 3. **Carrier**

The **Carrier** is the logistics company responsible for the transportation of goods. This can be a shipping line, trucking company, or other logistics provider. Carriers use DCSA-compliant APIs to:
- **Issue the eB/L**: Generate and manage the electronic Bill of Lading based on shipper requests.
- **Provide shipment tracking**: Offer real-time tracking information to shippers, consignees, and other stakeholders.
- **Facilitate communication**: Serve as the intermediary between shippers, consignees, and customs authorities to ensure smooth operations.
- **Manage cargo documentation**: Carriers ensure that all required documents, including the eB/L and customs forms, are properly handled and transferred via the API.

#### Key Responsibilities:
- Issuing and managing eB/Ls according to DCSA standards
- Facilitating real-time tracking and updates
- Managing and coordinating logistics documentation
- Ensuring smooth cargo handover between parties

### 4. **Banks (Trade Finance Providers)**

**Banks** and other financial institutions play a vital role in the trade financing aspect of the shipping process, particularly for large international transactions. They use DCSA-compliant APIs to:
- **Verify ownership through eB/L**: Ensure that the title to the goods is transferred securely using the electronic Bill of Lading.
- **Facilitate Letters of Credit (LC)**: Automate the verification and release of funds based on the terms of Letters of Credit or other trade finance agreements.
- **Ensure regulatory compliance**: Use standardized documentation to fulfill regulatory requirements for cross-border trade financing.

#### Key Responsibilities:
- Verifying and processing trade documents such as eB/Ls
- Facilitating payment processes and trade financing
- Ensuring the compliance of financial transactions with international trade standards

### 5. **Customs Authorities**

**Customs Authorities** are government bodies responsible for regulating and monitoring the entry and exit of goods in a country. Customs authorities interact with DCSA-compliant APIs to:
- **Verify eB/Ls**: Ensure that all shipments comply with local and international regulations, using the digital Bill of Lading for verification.
- **Manage customs documentation**: Facilitate the digital submission and approval of customs declarations and other necessary documents.
- **Monitor cargo movement**: Track and regulate the movement of goods in and out of the country, ensuring adherence to local laws.

#### Key Responsibilities:
- Verifying shipment documentation, including eB/Ls
- Ensuring compliance with local import/export regulations
- Approving customs clearance in real-time via API

### 6. **Port Community Systems (PCS) & Port Operating Systems (POS)**

**Port Systems**, including **Port Community Systems (PCS)** and **Port Operating Systems (POS)**, are responsible for managing port operations and facilitating communication between the port, shipping lines, customs, and other stakeholders. These systems interact with DCSA-compliant APIs to:
- **Optimize cargo handling**: Ensure efficient movement and storage of goods within the port.
- **Exchange data with Carriers and Customs**: Share real-time data on cargo movements and status updates.
- **Manage port operations**: Automate and streamline port processes such as scheduling, loading/unloading, and customs clearance.

#### Key Responsibilities:
- Facilitating data exchange between port authorities, carriers, and customs
- Managing cargo handling and port operations
- Ensuring real-time updates on cargo status and movement

## Collaboration and Data Exchange

Each of these stakeholders plays a vital role in ensuring the seamless movement of goods across borders. Through the use of DCSA-compliant APIs, they can collaborate more effectively by:
- **Sharing standardized data**: The DCSA standard ensures that all parties are using the same formats and protocols, reducing errors and miscommunication.
- **Tracking in real-time**: APIs enable real-time visibility into the status of shipments, helping to prevent delays and resolve issues more efficiently.
- **Ensuring security and compliance**: DCSA standards enforce stringent security measures to protect sensitive data and ensure compliance with international trade laws.

## Conclusion

The adoption of DCSA-compliant APIs significantly enhances the efficiency, security, and transparency of the shipping industry. Each stakeholder—whether a shipper, consignee, carrier, bank, customs authority, or port system—plays an integral role in the success of the global supply chain. By adhering to these standardized protocols, the shipping process becomes more streamlined and less prone to errors, benefiting all parties involved.
