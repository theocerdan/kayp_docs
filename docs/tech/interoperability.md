# Interoperability

Interoperability is a crucial topic for maritime trade, as it is the very reason for the creation of the DCSA standard. At KAYP, we integrate this standard at the API layer following the DCSA specifications (refer to the [Architecture](#architecture) page for more details).

Currently, several versions of this contract exist, and the long-term goal is to ensure that **all stable versions** can be integrated seamlessly. We leverage code generation tools to automatically generate standardized controllers based on the DCSA interface contract.

To learn more about the DCSA standard, please refer to the [dedicated documentation page](#dcsa-standard).

## Why is interoperability important?

The maritime industry involves multiple stakeholders, including shippers, carriers, and customs authorities, each of whom may use different systems for managing shipments. Interoperability ensures that these systems can communicate with each other efficiently, without compatibility issues. It is essential for:

- **Reducing delays** in communication between parties.
- **Ensuring accuracy** by preventing miscommunication or misinterpretation of data.
- **Enhancing transparency** by providing all participants with consistent and reliable information.

## KAYP's Approach to Interoperability

At KAYP, we are committed to making our platform **fully interoperable** with the DCSA standards. Here's how we achieve this:

- **API Layer Compliance:** Our DCSA-compliant API layer is designed to integrate with the standards, allowing for seamless communication with other platforms following the same specifications.

- **Support for Multiple Versions:** As new versions of the DCSA contracts are released, we aim to support all stable versions, ensuring that our system remains compatible with the latest developments in the maritime industry.

- **Automated Controller Generation:** Using interface contracts provided by DCSA, we generate standardized controllers through code generation tools. This approach reduces manual effort, minimizes errors, and ensures that our system remains compliant with the evolving standards.

## Future Plans

As part of our ongoing commitment to interoperability, we are continuously monitoring new updates from DCSA. Our goal is to provide an environment where different platforms can integrate effortlessly, regardless of the version of the DCSA standard they are using.
